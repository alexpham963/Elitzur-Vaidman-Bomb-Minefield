PROJECT: Elitzur-Vaidman-Bomb Quantum Minefield

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: We are creating a bomb disfusing game through gambling, with a quantum twist! By incorporating the Elitzurâ€“Vaidman quantum bomb tester, we add feature to the game where when the bomb is revealed by the player, the player now must use quantum computing to detect if the bomb is a dud or not. The game involves a field consisting of x's which indicates where a possible live or dud bomb exist.

The player can only disarm 4 times.
There are 8 bombs in the field (4 of them are alive while the other 4 are dud's)
The amount of trials that a player can have is 100.
This means that the player has to manage how many trials they have to use for each bomb

The reason why the player uses trials is because of the Quantum Detection method of the Elitzur Vaidman; which consist of using the Zenos Effect. The Zenos Effect is when a large amount of trials can affect the probability of the bomb being predicted and not exploding (a way to observe/interoggate if a bomb exist without actually having it explode)

The game is scalable in a sense that if you want a harder challenge you can change the amount of bombs, size of the space, etc
